## General Open Source License (GOSL)

### Introduction

Welcome to the General Open Source License (GOSL) repository. Authored by mcfrank, this license embodies the principles of open collaboration, the preservation of authors' rights, and the promotion of software sharing.

### Core Principles

#### 1. **Open Collaboration**

The GOSL champions the spirit of collective effort and innovation. It encourages the community to work together, fostering an environment where knowledge is freely exchanged.

#### 2. **Author's Rights**

While the GOSL promotes open collaboration, it also ensures that the original authors are recognized for their contributions. Their intent and rights are preserved, especially in commercial contexts.

#### 3. **Software Sharing**

In the digital age, the distribution and sharing of software have become pivotal. The GOSL is designed to facilitate this, ensuring software is accessible to as many as possible.

### Key Features of GOSL

- **Attribution**: Ensures that all projects using the Software or its Derivatives provide due credit to the original author.
  
- **Coauthor Recognition**: Mandates that derivatives recognize coauthors, detailing their contribution level and specific changes they've made.

- **Author's Authority**: The original author can modify the Software without having to mention coauthors and retains exclusive rights over its commercial applications.

- **Commercial & Patent Rights**: Before using the software for commercial purposes or seeking patents, one must acquire the author's written consent.

- **Distribution**: The GOSL must be included in all distributions. In cases of embedded use or inclusion as part of a service, consultation with the original author is obligatory.

- **Warranty & Liability**: The software under this license is provided "as-is". The author disclaims all warranties and isn't accountable for any issues arising from the software's use.

- **Termination**: Rights under this license can be terminated if its terms are breached.

### Using the GOSL

If you're a developer or organization looking to adopt a license that balances open collaboration with the preservation of author's rights, the GOSL might be perfect for you. To use it, simply include a copy of the GOSL in your project and ensure you adhere to its terms.

### Contributions & Feedback

As with any open-source initiative, feedback and contributions are welcome. If you have suggestions or amendments, please submit a pull request or open an issue.
